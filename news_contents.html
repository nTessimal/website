<p>We're happy to announce that we've joined the Central Florida Cluster Initiative! We are looking forward to provide our nanoparticle patterning technology to help collaborators build their novel next-gen biotech/compute/sensing devices.<br><a href="https://cenfluence.com/">https://cenfluence.com</a></p>

<h2>1/9/2024</h2>
<p>We have just submitted our Phase I NSF Seed Fund proposal to develop novel nanoparticle patterning chambers! With our expert technical team and PI Steve Snyder, who has 30 years of microelectronics miniaturization experience, we are confident in our likelihood of success. With letters of support and market pull from US based companies in the semiconductor and biomedical sectors we know our technology can make a world changing impact.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate the opportunity from the National Science Foundation, and the proposal process itself has already helped in our business development efforts.</p>
