<h2>Improving Manufacturability of Nanoparticle Devices with Multiphysics Assembly</h2>

<p>There are many new nanotechnology applications that require or can be enhanced by bottom-up nanoparticle assembly including 3D carbon nanotube compute, lab-on-a-chip diagnostic technology, MEMS antenna, NEMS sensors, and photonics including multiparticle quantum plasmonic computing. However, there is a significant commercialization gap due to a lack of a reliable and manufacturable bottom-up assembly process.</p>

<p>A deterministic method of assembling nano and microparticles is dielectrophoretic assembly (DEP). In DEP a particle suspended in solution and exposed to an AC field experiences a force along the gradient of the electric field and is assembled across the high gradient regions between parallel AC electrodes. Therefore, a pair of electrodes on the same dimensional scale as the particle can be used to align, assemble a particle between the electrodes. Once the particle is assembled it is held in place with electrostatic forces. Simulating this electric field gradient (FIG. 1) we see the gradient, and thus the DEP force, quickly drops off away from the electrodes further into the solution. This effect is exacerbated at smaller and smaller electrode pitches (FIG. 2).</p>

<p>To counteract this many scientists and engineers manufacture microfluidic channels from PDMS as tools to place over the electrodes that force nanoparticles in solution closer to the electrodes near the high-gradient regions (FIG. 3). However, this has major drawbacks impeding manufacturability, and in most cases, frustrating for use even in simple lab setups. The first challenge is that the microfluidic channel’s required height can become prohibitively small, causing ineffective flow, to have the full channel height be exposed to high DEP force. Additionally, at aspect ratios below 1:10 (height:width) microfluidic channels tend to collapse. This significantly limits the available area where nanoparticles can be patterned. So, for a large wafer either many channels would need to be formed in one large block or the block would need to be attached and detached from the wafer multiple times. The ability to pattern the area where the ribs of the microfluidic channels contact the substrate would also be lost. There are added costs and labor associated with manufacturing the microfluidic channels; they need to be replaced frequently due to contamination, and yield loss remains a factor due to the additional step of engaging/disengaging the channel. All this frustration is compounded as channels routinely lose adhesion due to the microfluidic channel’s necessary high-pressure differentials in the attached pumps.</p>

<p>With all these challenges, how can we bring novel nanoparticle devices to market? We want a solution where:</p>
<p>
(1) We don’t touch the surface of the wafer<br>
(2) Large areas can be patterned simultaneously without wasteful keep-out zones and<br>
(3) The same solution works for all electrode pitches.<br>
</p>
<p>This prompted us to incorporate a secondary DC electrode and the electrophoretic force into our novel multiphysics nanoparticle assembly chambers. With the electrophoretic force, a particle suspended in solution with a high zeta potential (charge near the particle’s surface at the slipping plane) experiences a force proportional to the electric field. Through finite element simulation we see that the average electric field between this DC electrode and our AC electrodes is approximately constant (FIG. 4). The 1D arc plot (FIG. 5) shows this in greater detail. In practice the electrophoretic force will be tuned experimentally and through simulations to be relatively weak and will slightly pull particles from the bulk solution near the electrodes where the dielectric force will then become the predominant driver of assembly.</p>

<p>With this multiphysics assembly solution we can eliminate a major obstacle in manufacturing novel devices from nanoparticles, while improving the ability to achieve higher yields at smaller pitches on larger area substrates than could be achieved with cumbersome microfluidics tools. This is one of the many advances nTessimal has included in our patent pending nanoparticle patterning chambers to help you commercialize groundbreaking nanoparticle-based devices.</p>
